## Inspiration
We took inspiration from endless runners such as Subway Surfer and Temple Run. The name references a classic rule of thumb about how long you have to escape a Nuclear Fallout area.

## What it does
The game is a post-apocalyptic endless runner (or biker), which randomly generates the road and obstacles ahead. You control the player using the LEFT and RIGHT arrows, and the SPACE bar to jump. The game would be easily extendable with more different road segments and obstacles, and if we had more time we would have liked to implement turning corners, add more different obstacles, and add fires and falling debris around the city.

## How we built it
We used Industry Standard tools such as Unity, C# and ProBuilder. We also used the amazing OpenGameArt to find assets / models to make our game visually distinctive. We also made extensive use of git and GitHub to enable a very parallel workflow, so we could all work on seperate features at once.

## Challenge we ran into
Learning how Unity physics worked was a big challenge, in order to deal with rotations and getting them working while the player is running continuously forward. We also had various issues with configuring and running Unity with Linux for one of our team members.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We successfully combined our varying knowledge and managed to work together efficiently on separate features. Team members with more experience with Unity were able to help those who were new to the engine using pair programming techniques and just acting as general 'mentors', while those with more programming experience helped with making the code more efficient and streamlined. 

## What I learned
Several of us learnt how to use Unity properly for the first time, having only limited experience in it before. We also did not have a huge amount of experience in C#, which was a good learning curve coming from a lot of Java experience. Learning how the structure, camera and prefabs worked was an interesting process, as was becoming more familiar with the system of updating frame by frame, and having different scripts interact with each different object.

## What's next for Blast Zone
We would love to expand the game further to add more depth! We had a lot of ideas for what extra features we could add to enhance the players experience, such as a more advanced scoring system involving collectables, multiple 'levels' to increase the difficulty and keep the player engaged, and more varied environments to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.
